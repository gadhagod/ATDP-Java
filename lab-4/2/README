Instructions: Use any IDE to write and execute the program below. Attach Snipping photos of your source code and execution of the code in the console. 
Hangman Game: Using Strings and strings methods, design a hangman game. 
You should have a list of words to choose from (at least 20 words between lengths of 5 and 7). When each game starts it should choose a word from the list randomly. 
Create a blank string with the exact size of your chosen word and fill it with underscores.
After each correct guess places all of the occurences of the correct letter in the blank string and displays it. (Hint: Use substring method to reconstruct the blank string)
If the user guesses a wrong letter, show a console-based hangman illustrating the progress. Please see the sample display below.

Keep all of the user guesses in an array of strings (or chars) and warn the user if they entered the same letter again.
The game should repeat until the user guesses the word or loses the game. Allow users to miss up to four or five letters. 
Add one more feature of your own. 
Good Luck and Have Fun
