Line 2: "integer" must be replaced by "double" to declare it's type. The double equals must be a single, to assign `b`. You must also put a semicolon following the statement.
Line 6: For the constructor, you must replace `MyClass` with `MyCla$$`. You must assign `this.b` instead of `b`,  because the program will think you are assigning the parameter `b`.
Line 7: Function `doIt` has an incorrect return type. `int` should be replaced with `void`, signifying nothing is to be returned.
Line 8: `â€™` cannot be used in variable names. The return type is incorrect as well, and must be changed to `MyCla$$`.

The correct code could be:

    class MyCla$$ {
        double x = 3.0;
        boolean b = false;

        // constructor	
        MyCla$$(boolean b) { this.b = b; }
        void doIt() {}
        
        MyCla$$ dontDoIt () { return this; }
    }
